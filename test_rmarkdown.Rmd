```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r include = FALSE}
library(viridis)
```

The code below demonstrates two color palettes in the [viridis](https://github.com/sjmgarnier/viridis) package. Each plot displays a contour map of the Maunga Whau volcano in Auckland, New Zealand.

## Viridis colors

```{r}
image(volcano, col = viridis(200))
```

## Magma colors

```{r}
image(volcano, col = viridis(200, option = "A"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
